# 9 Internal Workflows

If GovStack will offer global workflow management for cross-building block use cases, Identity and Verification Building Block will have its internal workflows for its own internal business flows execution.

Non-exhaustive list of examples:

* For onboarding a new individual.
* For managing identity changes after an event on a person's identity (name change, death, etc.).
* For life cycle management of an individual's identity evidence (i.e. ID Cards).
* For management of access rights to services on an individual's data.

Those workflows will be described in a later version, but some of them are already available as flow diagrams in this document ([Use Cases](6-functional-requirements.md#docs-internal-guid-dcbda535-7fff-1e71-07b5-815d5f9c5e1d)).
