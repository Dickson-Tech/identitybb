The results presented here benefit from publicly available sources that are referenced here. This report is recommending the use of open standards throughout any implementation. Here below are some of those standards which have been reviewed to prepare that specification:

For this purpose, the team is suggesting the following already available and recognized open standard providers:

* Federation protocol: [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1\_0.html).
* Image format for biometric data: [ISO-19794](https://www.iso.org/standard/50867.html).
* Verifiable credentials (to be covered in the next iteration of this document in more detail): World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/)).
* [ISO/IEC 24760](https://www.iso.org/standard/77582.html)
* Modular Open Source Identity Platform ([MOSIP](https://github.com/mosip)), which also includes information about their [APIs MOSIP](https://docs.mosip.io/platform/apis).
* Open Standard Identity APIs for interoperability within Identity System: [OSIA](https://osia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01%20-%20intro.html#problem-statement-lack-of-interoperability-in-identity-systems).
