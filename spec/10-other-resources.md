# 10 Other Resources

The results presented here benefit from publicly available sources that are referenced here. This report is recommending the use of open standards throughout any implementation. For this purpose, the team is suggesting the following already available and recognized open standard providers:

* APIs: [OSIA](https://osia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Federation protocol: [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/specs/).
* Image format for biometric data: [ISO-19794](https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=ISO%2019794).
* Verifiable credentials (to be covered in the next iteration of this document in more detail): World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)).
* ISO/IEC 24760

Equally, a future implementor might look for open-source options for the modules introduced in this document. In this case, the team is suggesting:

* Modular Open Source Identity Platform ([MOSIP](https://github.com/mosip)), which also includes information about their [APIs MOSIP](https://docs.mosip.io/platform/apis).
